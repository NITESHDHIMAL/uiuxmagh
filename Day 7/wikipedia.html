                    Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin of
                    the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the
                    fourth century AD.[16] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may
                    contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to
                    provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                    insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]
